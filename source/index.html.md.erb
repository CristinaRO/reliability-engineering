<intro to reliability engineering>

Reliabilty Engineering provide a shared platform to GDS teams with the tools needed to set up and maintain a service, we do this by:

* acquiring tools and where appropriate administer them for GDS, for example [Logit](https://logit.io/)
* running off-the-shelf services for GDS as internal SaaS, for example [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
* providing patterns and guidance, for example [PaaS incident templates](https://government-paas-team-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support/incident_process/)

To understand the context for our decisions and guidance you'll need to refer to the [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) and the [GDS Way](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital/#gds-technical-guidance).

These tools have been procured for use by GDS teams, we are updating our recommendations on how we use them.
