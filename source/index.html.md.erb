## Services we provide

### Logging

We provide ELK (elasticsearch/logstash/kibana) stacks via
[logit](https://logit.io).  We have guides to help you:

- Get a logit account (TODO)
- Ship logs from S3 to logit (TODO)
- [Send logs securely to Logit.io](manuals/logit-io.html)

The PaaS docs document
[how to send logs from PaaS to logit](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/#set-up-the-logit-io-log-management-service).

### Tech docs tool

We own the
[tech docs template](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template).

### Metrics

This is work in progress.
