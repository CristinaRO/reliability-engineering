## Services we provide

Reliabilty Engineering provide a shared platform to GDS teams with the tools you need to set up and maintain a service, we do this by:

* acquiring tools and where appropriate administer them for GDS, for example Logit
* running off-the-shelf services for GDS as internal SaaS, for example Prometheus
* providing patterns and guidance, for example PaaS incident templates

To understand the context for our decisions and guidance you'll need to refer to the [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) and [GDS Way](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital/#gds-technical-guidance).

### Logit

You can use Logit as your logging solution, it's been approved for use at GDS.

We provide ELK (elasticsearch/logstash/kibana) stacks using
[logit](https://logit.io).  We have guides to help you:

- [Get a logit account](manuals/logit-io-joiners-and-leavers.html)
- Ship logs from S3 to logit (guidance in progress)
- [Send logs securely to Logit.io](manuals/logit-io.html)
