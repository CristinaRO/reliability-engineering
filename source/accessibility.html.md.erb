# Accessibility statement for Reliability Engineering internal documentation

This accessibility statement applies to the Reliability Engineering internal documentation at [https://reliability-engineering.cloudapps.digital/](https://reliability-engineering.cloudapps.digital/).

This website is run by the Reliability Engineering team at the Government Digital Service (GDS). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

+ change colours, contrast levels and fonts
+ zoom in up to 300% without problems
+ navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
+ navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
+ listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## How accessible this website is

We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible for the following reasons:

- some links do not clearly explain where they lead, or that they lead to external sites
- some pages skip heading levels
- some images do not have good alternative text, or have no alternative text
- there are issues caused by our Technical Documentation Template

## Feedback and contact information

If you need any part of this service in a different format like large print, audio recording or braille, email [reliability-engineering@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](reliability-engineering@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

We’ll consider your request and get back to you within 2 working days.

## Reporting accessibility problems with this website

We’re always looking to improve the accessibility of this website. If you find any problems not listed on this page or think we’re not meeting accessibility requirements, email [reliability-engineering@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](reliability-engineering@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

### Enforcement procedure

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018
(the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, [contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)](https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/).

## Technical information about this website’s accessibility

GDS is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

### Compliance status

This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.

### Non-accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

#### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

Some links do not clearly explain where they lead, or that they lead to external sites. This fails [WCAG 2.1 success criteria 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-refs.html).

Some pages have redundant links. This is not a fail, but should be looked at under [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-refs.html).

There are some images which contain text, and a text-only alternative is not available. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion [1.4.5 (Images of Text)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#images-of-text).

There are parts of this documentation that are not accessible because of [issues caused by our Technical Documentation Template](https://tdt-documentation.london.cloudapps.digital/accessibility/#using-the-technical-documentation-template-for-your-own-documentation).

For example, some code examples use a colour that has very low contrast with the background colour, so the code may be difficult to see. This fails [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.3 - Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html).

## How we tested this website

We last tested this website for accessibility issues in August 2020.

We used manual and automated tests to look for issues such as:

- lack of keyboard accessibility
- link text that’s not descriptive
- non-unique or non-hierarchical headings
- italics, bold or block capital formatting
- inaccessible formatting in general
- inaccessible language
- inaccessible diagrams or images
- lack of colour contrast for text, important graphics and controls
- images not having meaningful alt text
- problems when using assistive technologies such as screen readers and screen magnifiers

## What we’re doing to improve accessibility

We plan to fix the accessibility issues in the content by the end of 2020.

We plan to fix the issues with the Technical Documentation Template by the end of 2020.
