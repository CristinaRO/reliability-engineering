# Continuous Integration and Delivery

The Reliability Engineering team uses [Concourse](https://concourse-ci.org) for testing and deploying code to production.

Concourse is a versatile, open-source, continuous thing-doer which can be used
for task automation, running tests and status checks against pull-requests, and
deploying code.

The Reliability Engineering team help you get started with Concourse, and ensure that the infrastructure is available.
