## Get started with Logit

If you do not have a Logit account you can create one by signing into Logit for the first time. Once you've created an account you must always sign into Logit the same way.

To sign into Logit:

1. Go to [https://dashboard.logit.io/sign-in](https://dashboard.logit.io/sign-in).
1. Switch to the "Single Sign-on" tab (note: this is currently very light grey text on a white background, so you may struggle to find it)
1. Enter your "Company Email Address"
1. Submit the form to complete Google Authentication.
1. You're now signed into the Government Digital Service Dashboard.

Once your user account is created, you'll need access to your team's logging stacks. Your team's Tech Lead should be a Logit administrator who will add your account.
