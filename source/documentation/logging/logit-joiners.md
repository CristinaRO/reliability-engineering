## Get started with Logit

If you do not have a Logit account you can create one by signing into Logit for the first time. Once you've created an account you must always sign into Logit the same way.

To sign into Logit:

1. Go to https://logit.io/ and select **Sign in**.
1. Enter your GDS email address in **Business email address**.
1. *...the password box should automatically disappear*.
1. Submit the form to complete Google Authentication.
1. You're now signed into the Government Digital Service Dashboard.

If you use **Log in with Google** on logit.io you will not sign into the GDS Dashboard.

Once your user account is created, you'll need access to your team's logging stacks. Your team's Tech Lead should be a Logit administrator who will add your account.
