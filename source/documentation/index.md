# Reliability Engineering

Reliability Engineering provide a shared platform to GDS teams comprising of tools to set up and maintain a service by:

* acquiring tools and where appropriate administers them like [Logit][]
* running off-the-shelf services as internal SaaS such as [Prometheus][]
* providing patterns and guidance like the [PaaS incident process][]

To understand the context for our decisions and guidance refer to:

* The [GDS Technology & Operations Principles][]
* The [Reliability Engineering Strategy][]
* The [Service Manual][]
* The [GDS Way][].

The Reliability Engineering documentation found on this site is intended to help the rest of GDS find out what Reliability Engineering is and what we're doing. If you're a member of Reliability Engineering or just curious about our team processes and ongoing work then please take a look at our [Team Manual][].
