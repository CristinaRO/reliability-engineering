## Update and remove access to Alphagov

When someone moves to another team within GDS individual teams need to remove/add user from/to their specific GDS [GitHub teams][].

When someone no longer requires access to [Alphagov][] because they've left GDS, their team is ultimately responsible for ensuring their GitHub account is removed from the Alphagov organisation.
