title: How to monitor your apps with Prometheus
---

# <%= current_page.data.title %>

[Prometheus][] uses service discovery to decide what it monitors, so for apps running on [GOV.UK PaaS][] you'll need to:

* grant Prometheus read-only access to your PaaS spaces
* bind your apps with the Prometheus service broker

### Grant Prometheus read-only access to your PaaS spaces

By giving prometheus-for-paas the [SpaceAuditor][] role you allow it to monitor each instance of your app and respond to events (start/stop/scaling).

`cf set-space-role prometheus-for-paas@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk <org-name> <space-name> SpaceAuditor`

### Use the service broker to bind Prometheus

The Prometheus service broker can be found in the PaaS marketplace.

```
❯ cf marketplace
service          plans        description
gds-prometheus   prometheus   GDS internal Prometheus monitoring alpha https://reliability-engineering.cloudapps.digital/#metrics
```

If you're unable to see `gds-prometheus` in the output of `cf marketplace` please contact us through the [#reliability-eng Slack channel].

Once you have the service broker you can create a Prometheus service within your PaaS space and allow it to bind to apps running there. Do this by following these steps:

1. Create a Prometheus service instance in each space you have Prometheus instrumented apps deployed
  - `❯ cf create-service gds-prometheus prometheus <service-instance-name>`
2. Either [update your app's manifest.yml] to bind your new service or bind it using the CLI
  - `❯ cf bind-service <app-name> <service-instance-name>`
3. Within 5 minutes Prometheus will start scraping your application for metrics

You can validate if your metrics are arriving by checking the [default Grafana dashboard](https://grafana-paas.cloudapps.digital).
