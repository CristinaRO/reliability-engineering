# <%= current_page.data.title %>

To find out about technical incidents affecting Logit you must:

* sign up to the [Reliability Engineering announcements][] Google Group
* join the [#reliability-eng Slack channel][]

Reliability Engineering uses these channels to tell GDS Logit users:

* about incidents such as Kibana or ElasticSearch being unavailable
* when an incident is resolved and normal service is resumed

Logit will keep in contact with Reliability Engineering during an incident, and ensure their [Logit status page][] is up to date.

## How you should report an incident

If you discover Logit or Kibana have failed, the process you must follow will differ depending on whether it occurred during or outside office hours.

### During office hours (9.30am to 5.30pm)

1. Check the [Logit status page][] to see if Logit know about the incident.
2. Join the #reliability-eng Slack channel and describe the problem.
3. Get confirmation that a Reliability Engineering team member has taken over the incident.
4. Wait for updates from [Reliability Engineering announcements][] or the [#reliability-eng  Slack channel][].

The Reliability Engineering Tools team will work directly with Logit coordinating communication on behalf of GDS.

### Outside office hours (from 5.30pm until 9.30am)

1. View the [Logit status page][] to check that Logit know about the incident.
2. If Logit do not know about the incident, and the issue is urgent, visit the [Logit home page][] and report the issue using Logit’s intercom system, indicated by the green message icon on the bottom right of the page:

![Logit Intercom](images/logit/logit_intercom.png)

3. Wait for updates from Logit through their Intercom system and their status page.

`Logit monitor their help desk informally out of hours, but do not yet have an on-call rota. We are working with them to resolve this.`

4. Join the [#reliability-eng Slack channel][] and describe the issue so Reliability Engineering can contact you when office hours resume.
5. When office hours resume, a Reliability Engineering team member will confirm they have taken over the incident.
6. Wait for updates from [Reliability Engineering announcements][] or the [#reliability-eng  Slack channel][].

The Reliability Engineering Tools team will work directly with Logit coordinating communication on behalf of GDS.

## How to find out about incident reviews

If Logit have a major incident, for example a full Logit outage, Reliability Engineering will announce an internal incident review using the [Reliability Engineering announcements][] Google Group, explaining how to register your interest in attending.

After the incident review meeting, Reliability Engineering will:

1. Email the incident report including a confirmed set of recommendations to [Reliability Engineering announcements][].
2. Follow up on actions arising from the incident review.
3. Follow up with Logit on any actions on their side, including claiming refunds for the month in question, according to our Enterprise SLA which is 99.9% uptime.
4. Email Logit’s own incident report to [Reliability Engineering announcements][]. Logit’s incident report will be sent out within 14 days of the incident.
