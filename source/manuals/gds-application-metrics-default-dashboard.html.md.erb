### What's powering this dashboard?

This dashboard has been built using the following metrics provided by Prometheus:

```
http_server_exceptions_total
http_server_request_duration_seconds_bucket
http_server_request_duration_seconds_count
http_server_request_duration_seconds_sum
http_server_requests_total
```

The widgets on the dashboard are the result of queries over these metrics. For example, the 'Number of requests per minute' widget is built from `http_server_requests_total` using Prometheus' [`sum`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/operators/#aggregation-operators) aggregator and [`rate`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/functions/#rate()) function.

2. Click this dropdown to see the list of available dashboards, some of which you can apply to change the view of your application.
3. Click this dropdown to see the list of applications currently instrumented with GDS metrics. In the screenshot, we have selected _registers.cloudapps.digital:80_.
4. Click these icons to interact with the dashboard. You can create a copy of the dashboard or share it, as well as changing the time period displayed.
5. View the widgets and graphs currently measuring the performance of your application. Click and drag on any of the graphs to zoom in on a particular time period. If you have editing permissions, you can click on any widget to configure or remove these.
