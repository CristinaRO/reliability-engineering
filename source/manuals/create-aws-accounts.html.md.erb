title: Creating AWS Accounts
---

# <%= current_page.data.title %>

Using multiple AWS accounts allows GDS to:

* Enforce administrative isolation between workloads
* Minimize the impact of security breaches
* Isolate audit data in separate accounts

See [the AWS multi-account guidance](https://aws.amazon.com/answers/account-management/aws-multi-account-security-strategy/).

Programmes can create as many AWS accounts as they need (usually at least one
production and non-production).

Requesting an account
---------------------

To request an account simply fill in and submit [this form](https://gds-request-an-aws-account.cloudapps.digital/).

The reliability engineering team will confirm that your account is eligible to
be included in GDS' AWS bill and perform the initial setup.

Once the account is created you will recieve an email with the account ID and
will be able to assume an administrative role from [the GDS users base account](https://gds-users.signin.aws.amazon.com/console).
You should use this role to set your new account up. We recommend that you
follow the [advice on managing cross account access](https://gds-way-aws-preview.cloudapps.digital/standards/aws-account-management.html)
in the GDS Way.
