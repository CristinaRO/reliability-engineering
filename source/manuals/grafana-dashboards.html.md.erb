## Display dashboards

Team dashboards are organised into separate Grafana folders.

Select **Home** in the top left of the Grafana **Home Dashboard** to choose your team’s dashboard folder and view your dashboards.

### Display using your team TV

You should use your TV’s Google Chromebit user to display your Grafana dashboard. The Google Chromebit user only has read access to Grafana.

You should not use your personal Google account to display your Grafana dashboard on your team’s TV. Your personal Google account may have editing or admin permissions.

## Create and edit dashboards

Contact Reliability Engineering using the [#re-prometheus-support Slack channel](https://gds.slack.com/messages/CAF5H4N4Q/#) to request:

* admin permissions to create or edit a dashboard in your team folder
* a new team folder and the admin rights to manage it
* copies of our example dashboards to customise

## Example dashboards

You can use the example dashboards in the **General** dashboard folder. These are a good starting point for customisation, or if you have set up monitoring to make sure everything works as expected.

### GDS Application Metrics Default Dashboard

The [GDS Application Metrics Default Dashboard](https://grafana-paas.cloudapps.digital/d/000000011/gds-default-dashboard?orgId=1) displays application metrics produced by [Ruby](https://github.com/alphagov/gds_metrics_ruby), [Java with Dropwizard](https://github.com/alphagov/gds_metrics_dropwizard) and [Python](https://github.com/alphagov/gds_metrics_python) clients.

If you’ve configured your application with one of these libraries you can view its metrics. You can do this by selecting your application from the **Available Apps** dropdown:

If your application is not displayed, check the instructions for [setting up metrics](../manuals/monitor-paas-app-with-prometheus.html) and that any changes are deployed to [GOV.UK Platform as a Service (PaaS)](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/).

### GDS Container Metrics Default Dashboard

The [GDS Container Metrics Default Dashboard](https://grafana-paas.cloudapps.digital/d/E2dUvczmz/container-metrics?orgId=1) displays container metrics produced by the [paas-metric-exporter](https://github.com/alphagov/paas-metric-exporter). Select your application from the **App** dropdown to view metrics for your application when you run the paas-metric-exporter.

If your application is not displayed, check the instructions for [setting up the PaaS metric exporter app with Prometheus](../manuals/set-up-paas-metric-exporter-with-prometheus.html) and that any changes are deployed to [GOV.UK Platform as a Service (PaaS)](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/).

### Official and community built dashboards

You can import [official and community built dashboards](https://grafana.com/dashboards). For example, you could display backing service metrics such as [ElasticSearch](https://grafana.com/dashboards/266) or [PostgreSQL](https://grafana.com/dashboards/455).

Learn how to [import dashboards](http://docs.grafana.org/reference/export_import/#importing-a-dashboard).
