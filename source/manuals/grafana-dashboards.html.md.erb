## Viewing your dashboards

Dashboards for teams have been organised into different Grafana folders.

Click 'Home' in the top left of the screen to pick your team's dashboard folder and see your dashboards.


## Creating and editing dashboards

In order to create or edit a dashboard in your team folder you will need to have the relevant permissions. Admin/editor permissions for your team folder can be granted by contacting us on the `#re-prometheus-support` Slack channel.

If you don't have a team folder, contact us on the `#re-prometheus-support` Slack channel to create the folder and get admin rights to manage it. If you would like your own copy of any of the default dashboards that you can personalise then please ask for this too.


## Default and example dashboards

In the 'General' dashboard folder, we provide default and template dashboards for you to use. These are a good starting point for customisation or if you have just set up monitoring to check that everything works as expected.

### GDS Application Metrics Default Dashboard

The [GDS Application Metrics Default Dashboard](https://grafana-paas.cloudapps.digital/d/000000011/gds-default-dashboard?orgId=1) shows application metrics produced by our [Ruby](https://github.com/alphagov/gds_metrics_ruby), [Java with Dropwizard](https://github.com/alphagov/gds_metrics_dropwizard) and [Python](https://github.com/alphagov/gds_metrics_python) clients. If you have instrumented your application with one of these libraries then you can view metrics for your application by selecting your application from the 'Available Apps' dropdown:

If you can't see your application in the list, make sure you've followed the instructions in [Setting up metrics](../manuals/monitor-paas-app-with-prometheus.html) and that your changes have been deployed to the [GOV.UK PaaS](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/).

[See a full explanation of what this default dashboard shows](../manuals/gds-application-metrics-default-dashboard.html)

### GDS Container Metrics Default Dashboard

The [GDS Container Metrics Default Dashboard](https://grafana-paas.cloudapps.digital/d/E2dUvczmz/container-metrics?orgId=1) shows container metrics produced by the [Paas Metric Exporter](https://github.com/alphagov/paas-metric-exporter). If you are running the PaaS metric exporter then you can view metrics for your application by selecting your application from the 'App' dropdown.

If you can't see your application in the list, make sure you've followed the instructions in [Set up the PaaS metric exporter app with Prometheus](../manuals/set-up-paas-metric-exporter-with-prometheus.html) and that your changes have been deployed to the [GOV.UK PaaS](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/).

### Official and community built dashboards

You can [import dashboards](http://docs.grafana.org/reference/export_import/#importing-a-dashboard) from the [official and community built dashboards](https://grafana.com/dashboards) on the Grafana website.


## How to view dashboards on your team TV

Use your TV’s Google Chromebit user to display your Grafana dashboard because the Google Chromebit user will only be able to access Grafana with read permissions.

You should not use your personal Google account to display your Grafana dashboard on your team’s TV. This is because your personal Google account may have editing or admin permissions.
