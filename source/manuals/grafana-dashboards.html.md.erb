*there should be a brief intro here - what is this content about, who’s it for?*

## Access Grafana

Sign in to Grafana at [grafana-paas.cloudapps.digital](https://grafana-paas.cloudapps.digital) using your GDS Google account.

## Display dashboards

Team dashboards are organised into separate Grafana folders.

Select **Home** in the top left of the Grafana screen to choose your team’s dashboard folder and view your dashboards.

### Display using your team TV

You should use your TV’s Google Chromebit user to display your Grafana dashboard. The Google Chromebit user only has read access to Grafana.

You should not use your personal Google account to display your Grafana dashboard on your team’s TV. Your personal Google account may have editing or admin permissions.

## Create and edit dashboards

Contact Reliability Engineering using the [#re-prometheus-support Slack channel][https://gds.slack.com/messages/CAF5H4N4Q/#] to request:

* admin permissions to create or edit a dashboard in your team folder
* a new team folder and the admin rights to manage it
* copies of default dashboards to customise

## Default and example dashboards

You can use the default and template dashboards in the **General** dashboard folder. These are a good starting point for customisation or if you have set up monitoring to check everything works as expected.

### GDS Application Metrics Default Dashboard

The [GDS Application Metrics Default Dashboard](https://grafana-paas.cloudapps.digital/d/000000011/gds-default-dashboard?orgId=1) displays application metrics produced by  [Ruby](https://github.com/alphagov/gds_metrics_ruby), [Java with Dropwizard](https://github.com/alphagov/gds_metrics_dropwizard) and [Python](https://github.com/alphagov/gds_metrics_python) clients.

If you’ve configured your application with one of these libraries you can view its metrics. You can do this by selecting your application from the **Available Apps** dropdown:

If your application is not displayed, check the instructions for [setting up metrics](../manuals/monitor-paas-app-with-prometheus.html) and that any changes are deployed to [GOV.UK Platform as a Service (PaaS)](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/).

You can see a full explanation of [what the default dashboard shows here](../manuals/gds-application-metrics-default-dashboard.html)

### GDS Container Metrics Default Dashboard

The [GDS Container Metrics Default Dashboard](https://grafana-paas.cloudapps.digital/d/E2dUvczmz/container-metrics?orgId=1) displays container metrics produced by the [paas-metric-exporter](https://github.com/alphagov/paas-metric-exporter).

If you’re running the PaaS metric exporter you can view metrics for your application by selecting it from the **App** dropdown.

If your application is not displayed, check the instructions for [setting up the PaaS metric exporter app with Prometheus](../manuals/set-up-paas-metric-exporter-with-prometheus.html) and that any changes are deployed to GOV.UK PaaS.

### Official and community built dashboards

You can [import dashboards](http://docs.grafana.org/reference/export_import/#importing-a-dashboard) from the [official and community built dashboards](https://grafana.com/dashboards) on the Grafana website.
