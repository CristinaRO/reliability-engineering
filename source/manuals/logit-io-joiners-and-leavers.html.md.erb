# <%= current_page.data.title %>

This page documents how to get a logit.io account, and how to manage
leavers.

## New users

Logit.io is available via GMail.  To log in: go to the Google Apps
Marketplace (the menu in the top-right), scroll to the bottom, and
click on the "Logit" icon.  The first time you do this, your account
will be automatically created.

Once your user account has been created, you need to be added to a
team to be able to access particular logging stacks.  Your tech lead
should be a logit administrator and be able to add you to your team;
if they are not, or they are not available, you can ask for help in
`#reliability-eng` on slack.

## Leavers

When people leave GDS and their G-Suite account is cancelled, they
will also lose access to logit.  However, their logit account will
still exist.  Therefore, when people leave GDS, please delete their
logit account too so that it is clear who still has current access to
it.
