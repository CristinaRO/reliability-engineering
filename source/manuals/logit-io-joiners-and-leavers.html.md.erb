# <%= current_page.data.title %>

This page documents how to get a logit.io account, and how to manage
leavers.

## New users

Create an account in Logit by logging in for the first time:

- Log into your GDS GMail account (or another G-Suite app such as
Calendar or Drive) in your browser
- Click on the 9 small dots at the top right of the page, click
"More" at the bottom to show more options, and scroll down
- Click on the "Logit" icon there and you'll be logged in

This is how you'll need to log into Logit in future too; using the
"Log in with Google" option on logit.io won't take you to the right
place.

Once your user account has been created, you need to be added to a
team to be able to access particular logging stacks.  Your tech lead
should be a logit administrator and be able to add you to your team;
if they are not, or they are not available, you can ask for help in
`#reliability-eng` on slack.

## Leavers

When people leave GDS and their G-Suite account is cancelled, they
will also lose access to logit.  However, their logit account will
still exist.  Therefore, when people leave GDS, please delete their
logit account too so that it is clear who still has current access to
it.
